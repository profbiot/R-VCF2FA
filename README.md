# R-VCF2FA
A simple Shiny app to annotate a FASTA file using information in a VCF file.  VCF file should be filtered.  This app is only as good as the information you feed into it and changes based in the FASTA file for every line in the VCF file. This version works for SNPs only.  Indel lines in the VCF file are ignored.
